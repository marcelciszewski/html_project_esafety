        <h1>E-Safety for 12-16 year olds</h1>


        <p class="lead">The internet is a very interesting place you can learn on it, you can get research for a project, and also you can connect with family and friends, but it can expose you to new types of dangerous risks. This page is about the risks of the Internet; E-Safety. This is a very important topic, that does not get talked about at home, or at school that very often. It is normally skipped, even though its massive importance. This website will display different e-safety topics, which are probably one of the more crucial and missed ones ones. </p>


        <p class="lead">This website will go over the risks and dangers of the following topics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Phishing & Scamming</li>
            <li>Live Streaming</li>
            <li>Inapprorpiate Images</li>
            <li>Gaming</li>
            <li>Social Media</li>
            <li>COMING SOON!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you need a quick summary of E-Safety, I highly recommend the following video. It will probably explain it much better then me.</p>
        <div style="float:left;margin:0 10px 5px 0;"><iframe width="306" height="210" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5JdM95WQKys" title="yt video 1a" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
        <p>Bascially, browsing the internet always carries risks. However, here are 3 basic rules you should follow. Firstly, don't go around sharing personal info to anyone who you don't know. This can easily get spread around the internet, creating huge privacy concerns. If this happens, immediately talk to a parent or guardian and don't worry. They should report directly to CEOP, who will try their very best to get rid of reposts on the internet. This is definately the best way to go to avoid it getting spread around even more. Secondly, don't click any suspicious links. They have a huge risk of having a piece of malware. If you click this type of link and you act that your computer is acting unusual, you should tell a parent or guardian. They should download an antivirus, like McAfee. These will remove your malware quickly and easily. Thirdly, do not say anything that may offend someone. If you do, it may ruin your online reputation and may affect your life. Delete it and tell an adult. There is indeed many more tips but I personally think these are the most important. </p>
